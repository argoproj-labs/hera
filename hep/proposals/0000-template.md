# Proposal

This provides a high level overview of the feature.

## Terminology

Define any new terminology.


## Code Examples

Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.

## How to teach (OPTIONAL)

If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing users and new users.


# Implementation (OPTIONAL)

This is the technical portion of the HEP, where you explain the design in sufficient detail.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Link to the Implementation PR

# Migration (OPTIONAL)

This section should document breaks to public API and breaks in compatibility due to this HEP's proposed changes. In addition, it should document the proposed steps that one would need to take to work through these changes.

# Drawbacks

Why should we **not** do this?

# Alternatives

- What other designs have been considered?
- Why is this proposal the best?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and bad.

# Unresolved Questions (OPTIONAL)

- What parts of the design do you expect to be resolved before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to be resolved through implementation of the feature?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HEP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this HEP?
