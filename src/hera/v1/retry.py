        -----
        It used to be the case that the Argo SDK required a `duration`/`max_duration` specification. However, that is
        no longer the case post-refactoring to the new SDK, which takes a `limit`. Until Hera migrates to V2, we can
        compute the limit from the specific `max_duration` and `duration`.
