# Artifact



This example showcases a simple artifact passing mechanism between two tasks.
The first task, writer, creates a file located at `/file` containing a message. The second
task, consumer, takes this artifact, places it at its own `/file` path, and print out the content.


=== "Hera"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from hera.workflows import DAG, Artifact, NoneArchiveStrategy, Workflow, script


    @script(outputs=Artifact(name="out-art", path="/tmp/file", archive=NoneArchiveStrategy()))
    def writer():
        with open("/tmp/file", "w+") as f:
            f.write("Hello, world!")


    @script(inputs=Artifact(name="in-art", path="/tmp/file"))
    def consumer():
        with open("/tmp/file", "r") as f:
            print(f.readlines())  # prints `Hello, world!` to `stdout`


    with Workflow(generate_name="artifact-", entrypoint="d") as w:
        with DAG(name="d"):
            w_ = writer()
            c = consumer(arguments=w_.get_artifact("out-art").as_name("in-art"))
            w_ >> c
    ```
