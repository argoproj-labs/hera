# Artifact Gc Workflow

## Note

This example is a replication of an Argo Workflow example in Hera.
The upstream example can be [found here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/artifact-gc-workflow.yaml).




=== "Hera"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from hera.workflows import (
        Container,
        S3Artifact,
        Workflow,
        models as m,
    )

    with Workflow(
        generate_name="artifact-gc-", entrypoint="main", artifact_gc=m.ArtifactGC(strategy="OnWorkflowDeletion")
    ) as w:
        main = Container(
            name="main",
            image="argoproj/argosay:v2",
            command=["sh", "-c"],
            args=['echo "hello world" > /tmp/on-completion.txt\necho "hello world" > /tmp/on-deletion.txt\n'],
            outputs=[
                S3Artifact(
                    name="on-completion",
                    path="/tmp/on-completion.txt",
                    key="on-completion.txt",
                    artifact_gc=m.ArtifactGC(strategy="OnWorkflowCompletion"),
                ),
                S3Artifact(
                    name="on-deletion",
                    path="/tmp/on-deletion.txt",
                    key="on-deletion.txt",
                ),
            ],
        )
    ```
