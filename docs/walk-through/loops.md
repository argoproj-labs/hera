# Loops

When writing Workflows, you may want to reuse a single template over a set of inputs. Argo exposes two mechanisms for
this looping, which are "with items" and "with param". These mechanisms function in exactly the same way, but as the
name suggests, "with param" lets you use a parameter to loop over, while "with items" is generally for a hard-coded list
of items. When using loops in Argo, the template will run in parallel for all the items; the items will be launched
sequentially but the running times may overlap. If you do not want to loop over the items in parallel, you should use a
[Synchronization](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/synchronization/) mechanism; see the
[Sequential Steps example](../examples/workflows/upstream/loops_arbitrary_sequential_steps.md).

## Loops in Hera

In pure Argo YAML specification, `withItems` and `withParam` are single values or JSON objects. In Hera, we can pass any
`Parameter` or serializable object, plus, `with_items` and `with_params` work exactly the same for hard-coded values.

## A Simple `with_items` Example

Consider the [Hello World](hello-world.md) example:

```py
@script()
def echo(message: str):
    print(message)


with Workflow(
    generate_name="hello-world-",
    entrypoint="steps",
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        echo(arguments={"message": "Hello world!"})
```

We can easily convert this to call `echo` for multiple strings; the only changes we need to make are in the function
call. First, specify the list of items you want to echo in the `with_items` kwarg:

```py
        echo(
            arguments={"message": "Hello world!"},
            with_items=["Hello world!", "I'm looping!", "Goodbye world!"],
        )
```

Now, we need to replace the value of the `message` argument. In Argo, you would use the `{{item}}` expression syntax,
which is also what we use in Hera (within a string):

```py
        echo(
            arguments={"message": "{{item}}"},
            with_items=["Hello world!", "I'm looping!", "Goodbye world!"],
        )
```

When running this Workflow, each value of `with_items` is passed to the `{{item}}` expression and runs in an independent
instance of the `echo` script container. Your Workflow logs should look something like:

```console
hello-world-9cf9j-echo-3186990983: Hello world!
hello-world-9cf9j-echo-4182774221: I'm looping!
hello-world-9cf9j-echo-1812072106: Goodbye world!
```

## `with_items` Using a Dictionary

We mentioned we can use any serializable object, so let's see how dictionaries are handled.

The `{{item}}` syntax represents the whole "item" passed in to the argument, so in the "hello world" example above, that
translates to just a string. For dictionaries, this `{{item}}` would translate to the whole dictionary. If instead we
want to pass values from the item dictionary to the function arguments, we provide them with Argo's key access syntax:
`{{item.key}}`.

Let's create a workflow to process everyone's favorite bubble tea orders!

First, a function that takes the customer's name, the drink flavor, ice level and sugar level:

```py
@script()
def make_bubble_tea(
    name: str,
    flavor: str,
    ice_level: float,
    sugar_level: float,
):
    print(
        f"Making {name}'s {flavor} bubble tea with {ice_level:.0%} ice and {sugar_level:.0%} sugar."
    )

```

Now, a Workflow with a `Steps` context:

```py
with Workflow(
    generate_name="make-drinks-",
    entrypoint="steps",
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        make_bubble_tea(...)
```

And now for each argument of `make_bubble_tea`, we can let Hera infer from the values in `with_item`! We just need to
pass a list of dictionaries, with the keys matching the `make_bubble_tea` arguments: "name", "flavor", "ice_level" and
"sugar_level":

```py
with Workflow(
    generate_name="make-drinks-",
    entrypoint="steps",
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        make_bubble_tea(
            with_items=[
                {
                    "name": "Elliot",
                    "flavor": "Taro Milk Tea",
                    "ice_level": 0.25,
                    "sugar_level": 0.75,
                },
                {
                    "name": "Flaviu",
                    "flavor": "Brown Sugar Milk Tea",
                    "ice_level": 1.00,
                    "sugar_level": 0.5,
                },
                {
                    "name": "Sambhav",
                    "flavor": "Green Tea",
                    "ice_level": 0.5,
                    "sugar_level": 0.25,
                },
            ],
        )
```

Running this Workflow, in the UI we'll see a fanout of three nodes, and the logs for "All" containers will show:

```console
make-drinks-h2qgq-make-bubble-tea-3759662853: Making Elliot's Taro Milk Tea bubble tea with 25% ice and 75% sugar.
make-drinks-h2qgq-make-bubble-tea-470512305: Making Sambhav's Green Tea bubble tea with 50% ice and 25% sugar.
make-drinks-h2qgq-make-bubble-tea-615962639: Making Flaviu's Brown Sugar Milk Tea bubble tea with 100% ice and 50% sugar.
```

Remember in the above example, we could swap out `with_item` for `with_param` and get the same output. `with_param` is
useful for passing dynamically generated lists and fanning out to process the list which we'll learn in the next section.

## Dynamic Fanout Using `with_param`

Let's improve our bubble tea maker by generating a dynamic list of orders! To do this, we'll need a new `create_orders`
function. We're going to make use of the script's `result` output parameter by dumping the orders to stdout.

Let's make our order randomizer:

```py
@script()
def create_orders():
    import json
    import random

    names = ["Elliot", "Flaviu", "Sambhav"]
    flavors = ["Brown Sugar Milk Tea", "Green Tea", "Taro Milk Tea"]
    levels = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

    orders = []
    for _ in range(random.randint(4, 7)):
        orders.append(
            {
                "name": random.choice(names),
                "flavor": random.choice(flavors),
                "ice_level": random.choice(levels),
                "sugar_level": random.choice(levels),
            }
        )

    print(json.dumps(orders, indent=4))  # indent is just used here for nice human-readable logs
```

> **Note:** we must import any modules used within the function itself, as Hera currently only passes the source lines
> of the function to Argo. If you need to import modules not in the standard Python image, use a custom image as
> described in [the `script` decorator](hello-world.md#the-script-decorator) section, or see the **experimental**
> [callable script](../examples/workflows/scripts/callable_script.md) example.

Now we can construct a Workflow that calls `create_orders`, and passes its `result` to `make_bubble_tea`. We'll need to
hold onto the `Step` returned from the `create_orders` call, and change `with_items` to `with_param` to use `.result`.
We'll keep the `arguments` the same, as the `.result` will be a json-encoded *list* of *dictionaries*!

```py
with Workflow(
    generate_name="make-drinks-",
    entrypoint="steps",
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        orders = create_orders()
        make_bubble_tea(with_param=orders.result)
```

## Aggregating Fan Out Results (Fan In)

Okay, we've made all these drinks, now we need to serve them up together!

For this, we can again use the `result` output parameter, but as we will use it on the `make_bubble_tea` step, it
expects JSON objects to aggregate them together.

Let's edit our `make_bubble_tea` function to dump a JSON object:

```py
@script()
def make_bubble_tea(
    name: str,
    flavor: str,
    ice_level: float,
    sugar_level: float,
):
    import json

    print(json.dumps({"name": name, "status": "Completed"}))
```

And now let's write a function to call out "Serving N orders" and the names attached to the orders:

```py
@script()
def serve_orders(orders: List[Dict[str, str]]):
    names = list(set([order["name"] for order in orders]))
    print(f"Serving {len(orders)} orders for {', '.join(names[:-1])} and {names[-1]}!")
```

In our Workflow, we can now link these scripts together with each Step's `result`:

```py
with Workflow(
    generate_name="make-drinks-",
    entrypoint="steps",
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        orders = create_orders()
        teas = make_bubble_tea(with_param=orders.result)
        serve_orders(arguments={"orders": teas.result})
```
