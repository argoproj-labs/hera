# Hello World

Let's take a look at the Workflow from the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) guide:

```py
from hera.workflows import Steps, Workflow, WorkflowsService, script


@script()
def echo(message: str):
    print(message)


with Workflow(
    generate_name="hello-world-",
    entrypoint="steps",
    namespace="argo",
    workflows_service=WorkflowsService(host="https://localhost:2746")
) as w:
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        echo(arguments={"message": "Hello world!"})

w.create()
```

## Hera Classes

Hera provides many specialised classes in `hera.workflows`. You will see the Argo Workflows spec has been transformed
into powerful Python classes. Hera also provides classes autogenerated from the spec in `hera.workflows.models`.

## Use *Any Function* on Argo

We can use Hera's `script` decorator to turn any user-defined function into a
[Script template](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/workflow-concepts/#script), which is mirrored in Hera as the
`Script` class.

### The `script` Decorator

The `script` decorator can take the kwargs that a `Script` [can take](../api/workflows/hera.md#hera.workflows.Script),
including `image`, `volumes`, `env`, and many more. This is how we can specify a different `image` of Python to use
instead of the default `python:3.9` for your script:

```py
@script(image="python:3.13")
def echo(message: str):
    print(message)
```

Alternatively, you can specify this image just once by using the `global_config.image` variable, and it will be used for
all script templates automatically:

```py
from hera.shared import global_config
global_config.image = "python:3.13"

@script()  # "echo" will use python:3.13
def echo(message: str):
    print(message)

@script()  # "echo_twice" will also use python:3.13
def echo_twice(message: str):
    print(message)
    print(message)
```

## The Workflow Context Manager

The Workflow context manager acts as a scope under which `template` Hera objects can be declared, which include
Containers, Scripts, DAGs [and more](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/workflow-concepts/#template-types). You
can provide values for the Workflow itself:

* `generate_name` is used by Argo to create a name by appending a random 5 character suffix, so you may see this
  Workflow run with a name like `hello-world-vmsz5`.
* `entrypoint` tells Argo which template to run upon submission.
* `namespace` is the Kubernetes namespace you want to run the Workflow in.
* `workflows_service` is Hera's REST API submission service.

## The Steps Context Manager

A `Steps` template is the second template type of this example. The `Steps` template is known as a "template invocator",
which is used to coordinate other templates, mainly Containers and Scripts, to do the actual work. In Hera, the `Steps`
class is a context manager; it automatically arranges your templates in the order that you add them, with each template
invocation known as a `Step`.

Clearly, `echo` takes a `message`, but we are passing in an `arguments`; this is actually syntactic sugar. Compare the
two snippets below which are functionally equivalent:

=== "Shorthand"

    ```py
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        echo(arguments={"message": "Hello world!"})
    ```

=== "Full"

    ```py
    with Steps(name="steps"):
        Step(
            name="echo",
            template=Script(name="echo", source=echo, inputs=[Parameter(name="message")]),
            arguments={"message": "Hello world!"},
        )
    ```

The "callable" syntax for your script templates intends to cut down boilerplate as much as possible, while keeping the
code intuitive.

## Submit the Workflow

Finally, with the workflow defined, the actual submisson occurs on

```py
w.create()
```

This uses the `WorkflowsService` to submit to Argo using its REST API, so `w.create()` can be thought of as running
`argo submit` from the CLI.

## Generate the YAML

It's important to recognise that Hera is a translation layer for Argo Workflows, which only understands YAML â€“ the YAML
Workflow should be considered the golden source when debugging.

You can generate the YAML for this Workflow using `w.to_yaml()`, or `w.to_file(name="hello-world.yaml")`:

```py
print(w.to_yaml())
```

```yaml

        import json
        try: message = json.loads(r'''{{inputs.parameters.message}}''')
        except: message = r'''{{inputs.parameters.message}}'''

        print(message)
      command:
      - python
```
