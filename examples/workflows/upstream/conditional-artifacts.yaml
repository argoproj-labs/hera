    workflows.argoproj.io/description: Conditional aartifacts provide a way to choose
      the output artifacts based on expression. In this example the main template
      has two steps which will run conditionall using `when` . Based on the `when`
      condition one of step will not execute. The main template's output artifact
      named "result" will be set to the executed step's output.
