# Upstream Examples

The "Upstream" collection contains examples
[directly from the Argo Workflows repository](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/6e97c7d/examples), such as
the [DAG Diamond example](workflows/upstream/dag_diamond.md), to demonstrate how the YAML spec maps to Hera classes.
These examples are generated and compared in Hera's CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all the examples are possible to
recreate in Hera.
