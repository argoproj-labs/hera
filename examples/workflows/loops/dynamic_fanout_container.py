This example showcases how clients can use Hera to dynamically generate tasks that process outputs from one task in
parallel. Differ from dynamic_fanout.py, this example uses a container to generate the tasks and the dynamically
created tasks are also container only.
More details can be found here: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/hera-workflows/issues/250
