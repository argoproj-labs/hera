"""
This example showcases how clients can use Hera to dynamically generate tasks that process outputs from one task in
parallel. This is useful for batch jobs and instances where clients do not know ahead of time how many tasks/entities
they may need to process. In addition to the fanout, this example showcases how one can set up extra parameters for
the job to dictate what the fanout should execute over.
