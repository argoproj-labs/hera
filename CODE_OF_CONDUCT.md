# Code of conduct

While Hera is not a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) project, it supports, endorses, and
echoes the code of conduct presented by the CNCF. The CNCF code of conduct can be found
[here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). Full credit goes to the CNCF project for
establishing the linked code of conduct principles.

Instances of behaviors that are not aligned with the values proposed by CNCF can be reported to
