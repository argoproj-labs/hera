[the CNCF design proposal template](https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/DESIGN-PROPOSALS.md?plain=1).

### Setting up

If you plan to submit contributions to Hera you can install Hera in a virtual environment managed by `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can use the various `make` targets to replicate the `CI` jobs.

```
make help
check-codegen                  Check if the code is up to date
ci                             Run all the CI checks
codegen                        Generate all the code
events-models                  Generate the Events models portion of Argo Workflows
events-service                 Generate the events service option of Hera
examples                       Generate all the examples
format                         Format and sort imports for source, tests, examples, etc.
help                           Showcase the help instructions for all the available `make` commands
lint                           Run a `lint` process on Hera and report problems
models                         Generate all the Argo Workflows models
services                       Generate the services of Hera
test                           Run tests for Hera
workflows-models               Generate the Workflows models portion of Argo Workflows
workflows-service              Generate the Workflows service option of Hera
```

#### Working in VSCode

If your preferred IDE is VSCode, you may have an issue using the integrated Testing extension where breakpoints are not
respected. To solve this, add the following as a config in your `.vscode/launch.json` file:

```json
{
   "name": "Debug Tests",
   "type": "debugpy", // "python" is now deprecated
   "request": "launch",
   "purpose": ["debug-test"],
   "console": "integratedTerminal",
   "justMyCode": false,
   "env": {"PYTEST_ADDOPTS": "--no-cov"}
}
```

## Contributing checklist

Please keep in mind the following guidelines and practices when contributing to Hera:

1. Your commit must be signed (`git commit --signoff`). Hera uses the [DCO application](https://github.com/apps/dco)
   that enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) on commits.
1. Use `make format` to format the repository code. `make format` maps to a usage of
   [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/), and the repository adheres to whatever `ruff` uses as its strict pep8
   format. No questions asked!
1. Use `make lint test` to lint, run tests, and typecheck on the project.
1. Add unit tests for any new code you write.
1. Add an example, or extend an existing example, with any new features you may add. Use `make examples` to ensure that
   the documentation and examples are in sync.

## Adding new Workflow YAML generation tests

Hera has an automated-test harness that is coupled with our documentation. In order to add new tests, please follow these steps -

### Local Hera examples

Tests that do not correspond to any upstream Argo Workflow examples should live in `examples/workflows/*.py`

In order to add a new workflow test to test Hera functionality, do the following -

* Create a new file under `examples/workflows`, for example - `my_test.py`
* Define your new workflow. Make sure that the target workflow you wish to export and test against is named `w`
* Run tests using `make test`. Hera tests will generate a golden copy of the output YAML with the name `my-test.yaml` if
  it does not exist already
* If you would like to update the golden copy of the test files, you can run `make regenerate-test-data`
* The golden copies must be checked in to ensure that regressions may be caught in the future

### Upstream Hera examples

Tests that correspond to any
[upstream Argo Workflow examples](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/main/examples) should live in
`examples/workflows/upstream/*.py`. These tests exist to ensure that Hera has complete parity with Argo Workflows and
also to catch any regressions that might happen.

In order to add a new workflow test to test Hera functionality, do the following -

* Create a new file under `examples/workflows/upstream` that corresponds with the name of the upstream example yaml
  file. If the yaml file has a hyphen, your python file name should replace those with an underscore. eg. if you are
  trying to replicate
  [archive-location.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/archive-location.yaml) your
  python file should be called `archive_location.py`
* Define your new workflow. Make sure that the target workflow you wish to export and test against is named `w`
* Run tests using `make test`. Hera tests will generate a golden copy of the output YAML with the name
  `archive-location.yaml` and also generate a local copy of the upstream yaml file with the name
  `archive-location.upstream.yaml`
* If you would like to update the golden copy of the test files, you can run `make regenerate-test-data`
* The golden copies must be checked in to ensure that regressions may be caught in the future

## Adding new Workflow on-cluster tests

Hera's CICD spins up Argo Workflows on a local Kubernetes cluster, which runs tests decorated with
`@pytest.mark.on_cluster`. If you want to add more on-cluster tests, the easiest way is through a GitHub Codespace. You
can then run the same `make` commands that run in CICD:

```
make install-k3d
```

This will install the k3d CLI.

```
make run-argo
```

This will create a cluster using k3d called `test-cluster`, then create a namespace called `argo` on it, applying the
argo configuration, and patching the deployment to use `server` as the `auth-mode`, meaning the connection to submit the
workflow doesn't require an authentication mechanism.

You can then run existing on-cluster tests to ensure everything is set up correctly. This command also ports-forward the
server's port.

```
make test-on-cluster
```

### Viewing the Argo UI from a Codespace

> Before doing this, note that **anyone** will be able to connect using the Argo UI URL!

Ensure Argo Workflows is running using the `make` command:

```
make run-argo
```

Forward the Server's port using kubectl:

```
kubectl -n argo port-forward deployment/argo-server 2746:2746
```

Then, go to the `PORTS` panel in VSCode, and add the `2746` port. You should see a green circle to the left of the port.
Then right click on the `2746` row and set `Port Visibility` to `public`. You can then open the URL in your browser to view the Argo UI.
