# Hera Governance

This document outlines the governance for the Hera Project.

Any changes to Hera's governance and this document require a unanimous vote by all TOC members.

All votes mentioned in this document follow a [lazy-consensus process](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/lazy_consensus/) with a default time-period of 2 weeks unless they are mentioned to be unanimous in which case they require unanimous consensus from all binding voters.
